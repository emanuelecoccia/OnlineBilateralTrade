This repository contains the implementation of online algorithms for bilateral trade problems. 

For linear bandits, use Limit Order Book data from https://lobsterdata.com as contextual information for private valuations of buyers and sellers. The dataset can be downloaded from https://lobsterdata.com/info/sample/LOBSTER_SampleFile_MSFT_2012-06-21_10.zip.

In the linear_bandits folder you can find an implementation of the ellipsoid algorithms from Feature-Based Dynamic Pricing (Cohen et al. 2020) and Feature-Based Online Bilateral Trade (Gaucher et al. 2024).
