This repository contains the implementation of online algorithms for bilateral trade problems. 

We use Limit Order Book data from https://lobsterdata.com as contextual information for private valuations of buyers and sellers. 

So far we implemented the ellipsoid algorithms from Feature-Based Dynamic Pricing (Cohen et al. 2020) and Feature-Based Online Bilateral Trade (Gaucher et al. 2024).
